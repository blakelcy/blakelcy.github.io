            <h4>UI Designer/UI Developer Consultant</h4>
            <p>Currently working on updating a section of a local hospitalâ€™s website. This includes working 
              with existing design files in Sketch and importing them to InVision, updating based off stakeholder 
              interviews, and developing them in the current codebase.</p>

            <h4>UI Designer/UI Developer Consultant</h4>
            <p>Created reusable components in an Angular application for a medical research company. 
              Along with providing design feedback and taking part in stakeholder interviews, I wrote custom 
              CSS and HTML for our Angular based application. Components were developed to be reusable following 
              Component Driven Development standards and were maintained in the Pattern Library tool Storybook.</p>

            <h4>UI Designer/UI Developer Consultant</h4>
            <p>A local hospital had created a patient recording application using Dash, 
              a data and graph framework. After interviewing the main user and discovering the 
              experience issues she was having, I was tasked with overhauling the CSS and flow to better 
              enhance the visual experience as well as the overall usability of the application. </p>
            
            <h4>UI Developer Consultant</h4>
            <p>I worked as the lead User Interface Developer for a large enterprise client in the banking industry. 
              With the project having been in development prior to my involvements, I set about implementing the ITCSS 
              methodology as well as BEM and namespacing, which allowed for a much more readable and scalable codebase. 
              Additional duties include writing new UI components, working with Angular developers to ensure correct DOM 
              structure as well as participating in user interviews and design mockups. Additionally, I began work on a 
              pattern library to help document our apps components and better define how we use them.</p>

            <h4>UI Developer Consultant</h4>
            <p>I worked as a User Interface Developer writing components in PatternLab using mustache, gulp, and SASS for 53.com. 
              Prior to the start of development, our team organized and led a component inventory exercise where we brought in 
              stakeholders and asked them to identify key and important parts of the website. Once organized, newly styled components 
              were created and converted into the PatternLab which eventually became 53.com.</p>
